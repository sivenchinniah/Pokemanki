# Pokémanki

Keep motivated to do Anki by catching and training Pokémon to become the very best!

## How it works

Pokémanki gives you a Pokémon (or an egg which will hatch into a Pokémon) for each lowest-level deck (deck without
sub-decks) in your collection that you have started learning. As you learn and review the cards in that deck, your
Pokémon will level up and may even evolve!

### Viewing your Pokémon

Your Pokémon can be accessed by viewing your Stats, where they will be above the rest of charts and figures.

Here you can see either the Pokémon for the specific deck or for the whole collection by clicking "deck" or "collection"
at the bottom of the Stats screen.

### Trading Pokémon

Every day you'll get three trade offers from other masters, which will allow you to exchange your Pokémon for theirs.

You can access the trades from Pokémanki's menu, under the Tools menu.

### Pokémanki's menu

From Anki's Tools menu you can access Pokémanki's menu, which has the following items:

- **Decks vs. Tags:** Choose whether to catch Pokémon from decks or tags. *(Not all Pokémanki's features are available
  when in Tags mode.)*
- **Nicknames:** Make your Pokémon yours by giving them a nickname!
- **Prestige Menu:** Lower a Pokémon's level by 50, so they can keep growing.
- **Everstone:** Keep a Pokémon in their current evolution form, regardless of level.
- **Mega Stone:** Make a Pokémon undergo a mega evolution.
- **Alolan Passport:** Change a Pokémon to their Alolan variant.
- **Trade:** Open the Trade window to exchange your Pokémon.
- **Reset:** Reset your Pokémon and all of the add-on's configuration.

### Config menu

From Anki's add-on menu you can access Pokémanki's config settings, which allows you to choose whether your Pokémon
get X or Y mega evolutions, and what generation of Pokémon are available to be caught.
